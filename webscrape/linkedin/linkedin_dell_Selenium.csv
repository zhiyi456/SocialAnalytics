We created a website for inventory management by scraping the data from the email and updating the data to our inventory table. Due to time constrain we only used basic HTML CSS, jQuery for the front end, and PHP for our backend. After a day of continuous coding, we managed to hit the third place in the hackathon. And the great thing was that my teammates also managed to secure a job placement at Dell.

"8 years ago, studying at Zewail City was just a ""dream"" for me. Two weeks ago, I graduated from Zewail City of Science and Technology!     In school, I have always been a top achiever. I got the First Place award in my senior year (Thanaweya Amma) for the highest grade in my school. However, I still doubted whether I could pass the university's admission tests! I decided to give it a try and studied for them, but I wasn't satisfied at all with my performance. I was quite sure that I won't get accepted. But then, I got accepted! (The impostor phenomenon had another opinion though😂)     During my college days, I always believed that my work in the courses, especially projects, isn't good enough. Throughout these 5 years, I tried to make use of every single opportunity to learn and grow. I was NEVER satisfied and that had always pushed me to work even harder!      In my journey, I KNEW that if I can't understand any concept, there was always someone (a student/ Dr/ TA) here to help, without anything in return!     In my journey, I met the best and smartest people ever. Being surrounded by them has developed my way of thinking. Also, being part of a community from diverse backgrounds with different points of view has made me more flexible and open-minded.     In my journey, I always felt blessed for studying a field that I'm really PASSIONATE about by the most wonderful professors.     In my journey, I unlocked capabilities in myself that I didn’t know existed, either through student activities/ competitions/ group projects.     In my journey, I discovered that I was a perfectionist! I wanted everything to be 100% perfect, and that was the reason why I always doubted myself and was never satisfied with my performance!   “Until you realize perfection is an ideal and not a reality, you will never have self-confidence.” ― J.S. Felts     But then,  I learned that perfectionism is an “illusion”. There is nothing perfect. I was trying to reach something that didn’t exist and doubted myself for not succeeding! Now, I seek “balance”. Balance is the key. I try to produce the best possible outcome within the given time. Efficiency!  “Be prolific, not perfect.” ―Richie Norton  “Imperfection facilitates improvement, perfection facilitates stagnation.” ―Abhijit Naskar    Finally, I graduated with an Excellent degree and a recognition medal for serving the ZC community through winning first place in Dell's hackathon and participating in a student activity (IEEE) as a head of a team in a major event. Also, I got straight A's in all of the courses in my senior year in both semesters (GPA 4.00/4.00), which was one of the hardest years. On top of that, I and my team won first place in CIE Projects Exhibition 2022 for the best graduation project.     Do not seek perfectionism, just focus on “improvement”.    That was just a glimpse of my journey in Zewail City.  I believe I'm ready for the next steps!",Data Engineer @adam.ai

"Last Thursday, I was privileged enough to participate in Dell's Virtual Hack2Hire hackathon as my first real-deal hackathon (develop a prototype in under 24 hours). Co-leading the team alongside Daniel Wan Jonathan was no doubt an eye-opening experience. Here are some of my key takeaways:    1. Emphasis on each members' expertise is paramount to your team's success. Since this was our first time working on a fast-paced project, a slight lack of expertise in a certain domain/framework can slow down your progress by a considerable degree.    2. “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” – Benjamin Franklin. The planning phase in software development is crucial when working with a deadline. Even though our team took the initiative to break down the modules to be developed using Trello, we realized certain key aspects were left out eg. the wireframing of our user interface, as too much emphasis was placed on the backend logic of our application.    3. Communication is key when attempting to convey your ideas to your team members and stakeholders. As future developers, the ability to think clearly determines your ability to relay information. Clear thinking == clear communication.    All in all, I want to give a huge shoutout to my Logos teammates , and for tanking through a whole day of continuous coding, as well as for mentoring us from the development side of things all the way to the presentation. Although we couldn't achieve exactly what we initially set out to do, we definitely had a ton of fun and learned a lot along the way under your mentorship.    I would also like to thank for the internship opportunity for my next semester. Very excited for what's to come!",Intern at Dell Technologies | KopiDAO Scholar | Treasurer at Teraju Siswa UM | BCS (Software Engineering) at Universiti Malaya

"In SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022, my TEAM TAGAR won 2nd Place.    I took advantage of my summer break to participate in my first hackathon - SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022 - with my TAGAR teammates: Godwinn W.    Our project aims to help reduce SCDF Paramedics' cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network, and presenting it in an easy-to-read and accessible way. Through our application, we also made case-specific Just-in-Time revisions easily accessible.    Having served national service as a Medic, my team and I understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid particular attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. By improving the processes, we then aimed to increase their germane load without changing the way they think or act.    The experience of working with cloud computing technologies and machine learning was brand-new to me. Designing and developing a cloud-native minimum viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to Dell's VMware was a challenge. Furthermore, I learned a lot about machine learning concepts related to text classification specifically bags of word models.    Through this experience, I gained essential developer skills such as Flask, Dockers, and Tanzu App. Though I am only scratching the surface of what I can do with my development skills, I am happy to announce that I have found my passion and interest in being a developer. The fact that I participated and gave it my best is extremely rewarding to me.    Special Thanks  Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon.

After thinking, I decided to simply send my name and give it a go. I've been teamed up with my new friends from UTHM. Since this is my first time participating in a hackathon, I am to do my very best to my team as much as possible and give exposure to my team members as they are from different backgrounds. It was a big for us at first, but nothing couldn’t be overcome with the team's excellent and . I’m happy to guide my team and it was definitely a great experience for me.

Surprisingly, towards the end of the session, I saw my name was on the list as a selected applicant, with an immediate employment offer attached.

"Hace aproximadamente 2 años un amigo me comentó sobre el FIUBA Consulting Club un tal grupo de consultoría hecho por alumnos de FIUBA que estaban necesitando gente para expandirse. Luego de un proceso de selección, entre con mucha motivación y pude conocer una gran cantidad de gente con ganas de revolucionar el método educativo institucional, dando a conocer un mundo totalmente diferente al académico.    Fui aprendiendo de grandes tutores que no solamente me transmitieron “hard skills” y enseñaron herramientas nuevas, sino que por sobre todo me ayudaron a entender mucho mas en profundidad el significado de trabajo de equipo, dedicación y empatía.    Este fin de semana pasado tuvo lugar el Fiubaton, evento de hackathon de innovación creado por el Club en 2019, evento del cual pude tener el honor de haber sido coorganizador junto con y . Para el evento en cuestión, teníamos como objetivo inculcar los valores y visión del Club en los participantes, para así trasmitirles nuestra motivación para salir al mundo con una cabeza bien abierta. El evento alcanzó a tener a mas de 150 participantes, contando con la participación de mas de 30 integrantes del Club que se desvivieron por que todo salga lo mejor posible.    A pesar de ser ya Senior en el Club, este evento me enseño un par de lecciones. Por un lado, gracias a Matías pude aprender que por más imposible que se vea una situación o inconveniente, con perseverancia y trabajo duro (también con un ocasional alooo) siempre se sale adelante. Por otra parte, Marcos me enseñó a que a veces la solución es mucho más simple de lo que aparenta y cómo ganarse el corazón de la gente que te rodea (y que no existe un número suficiente de fosforítos).    Finalmente, el me demostró nuevamente el gran corazón que tiene y que siempre pero siempre ponerse la camiseta con el logo del alfil vale la pena.  Gracias también a todo el escuadrón de FIUBATON que hizo posible esto:      Gracias también a y porque siempre están y son excelentes directores.      Para concluir, quería agradecer también a las empresas que hicieron todo esto posible:",Coordinador de desarrollo de proyectos en FIUBA Consulting Club

"‼️ Facciamo il punto, dopo 3 anni di business a #Palermo 🤯    Una città dove le realtà IT più innovative fanno siti web in WordPress e vendono corsi che ti promettono di cambiare la tua vita, manco fossero Tony Robbins.    Un territorio dove il concetto di coworking è ridotto ad un luogo che affitta stanze (rigorosamente riservate. Non sia mai ti rubino un cliente).    Dove personaggi di dubbia professionalità si spacciano per Advisor, Trainer e Startup Coach quando non hanno mai avuto un successo nel business.    Dove le aziende ti nascondo al loro team per paura che uno dei loro talenti, appena formato nello sviluppo in jQuery (e pagato in buoni pasto) possa venire a lavorare per la tua azienda.    Dove “ti pago in visibilità” e “lavorare in modo flessibile” significa fare 12 ore di lavoro al giorno mentre vieni assunto part-time.    Dove è più importante apparire.  Non importa se su un social mentre alzi il “Premio Barzotto” o su un articolo nel giornale del paese.    Per non parlare dei vari hackathon e pseudo startup weekend, che l’unica cosa che insegnano è che…bello adesso la mia idea è una startup e posso scrivere “Founder e CEO” sul mio profilo LinkedIn.    Una città che durante le elezioni promuoveva personaggi che sfruttavano l’entusiasmo di giovani startupper raccontando che avrebbero dato loro un’opportunità per costruire una in cambio del loro voto (e se portavi mamma, papà, zio, nonni etc… anche meglio).    Dove le aziende che vantano qualche piccolo successo, se la tirano manco fossero Y Combinator, vivendo di progetti passati di dubbia utilità e finiti miseramente.    Bè cari amici, dovrei dirvi che è una città difficile dove fare business. Dove c’è grande ego e tanta ipocrisia, ma devo dirvi che io a questa città ne sono grato.    Perché mi ha dato un gruppo di amici con cui condivido tutti i giorni sogni e la passione per la programmazione.    È difficile raccontare com’è la vita in , i progetti che stiamo portando avanti e come siamo diventati una delle realtà IT più richieste nel mondo , sviluppando un Metaverso in , creando nuove cripto, sistemi per lo sviluppo di e tanto altro …. ma se venite a trovarci capirete quanto c**o sono fighi questi qua 👇🏻❤️    , , , , , , , , Giuliano Randazzo, Giovanni Di Gregorio, Giorgio Sangiorgi, Roberto Valenza, Daniele Maione.",Founder bitRocket.dev

"I've had an incredible 9 weeks as a Digital & Global Business Operations Project Management Intern at Dell Technologies! Here are some of my most impactful memories:    🎯 Project    This summer, I worked on ’s team to help make our in-app digital sales enablement tool robust and accessible before it deploys to sellers more internationally.

"Today marks the end of my 12-week internship journey as a Worldwide Procurement Intern in Dell Technologies. Recognised as having one of the world's best supply chains, I applied for an internship position here with the intention of learning from world-class industry experts in the supply-chain field. After 3 months here in Dell, I can confidently say that I have left with so much more.     For me, the biggest takeaway from Dell is to dig deep and always be curious. When I first stepped into the office, I was immediately introduced to the concept of 1X1s - 1 on 1 meetings with any partner to learn more about their work function or to gain insights on a particular issue. Questions are welcomed, if not highly encouraged, in Dell and despite how busy the managers and mentors were, my questions were always thoughtfully answered. This has helped me gain tons of insights not only in procurement, but in other job functions as well.     On top of this, I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities all interns were given to showcase and refine our skills. There was never a dull day in the office. From hackathons to projects focused on aiding the team solve real-world issues, we were constantly being challenged to think critically and analytically. Though I admit it got hectic at times, the warm and supportive culture in Dell was of great help through these tough times.     Although this 12-week internship was just the tip of the iceberg into the procurement field, my perspective has definitely broadened from the numerous 1X1s, Brown Bags, Executive Speaker Series, networking sessions and department events with the outstanding team here in Dell.     I'd like to thank my intern team for being such remarkable group mates to work with and learn from. I am grateful for the team's ""never-say-die"" spirit - supporting each other throughout no matter how tough it got. I'd also like to thank for sacrificing precious work hours to answer our never-ending set of questions and for being the best buddy any intern could ask for. Also huge thanks to for his superb mentorship and perceptive feedback on our projects, Christe Elmenzo for being such a supportive and approachable mentor, for his technical expertise and guidance, and core team for an unforgettable internship programme, and all other interns for such a wholesome and vibrant experience.     Once again, heartfelt thanks to for this opportunity. Till next time!",NUS | Business Administration with Double Major in Economics

"Maps Group | Sharing Knowledge e l'#hackathon in sanità    ""AL MIGLIOR PROGETTO DI INNOVAZIONE PER MIGLIORARE LA QUALITA' DI VITA DEI PAZIENTI CON MALATTIE RARE""    Può sembrare un gioco l'hackathon, ma non lo è.  Specialmente se il tema è quello delle malattie rare.  E così, con serietà, concretezza e professionalità abbiamo affrontato un argomento complesso e delicato.  Abbiamo cercato e intervistato chi, in prima persona, vive questa difficoltà, con l'obiettivo di capire e toccare con mano quale sia la quotidianità della vita e cosa davvero potesse essere fatto per innovare e aiutare.    Il team, composto dai colleghi , ha ideato una piattaforma tecnologica dedicata al caregiver. Il progetto si chiama e la finalità è quella di formare al meglio il caregiver per fargli conoscere i vari aspetti della malattia rara in questione e renderlo quindi autonomo - in modo particolare - nei momenti di emergenza.  Una serie di test validano e certificano il livello di preparazione che, via via nel tempo, il caregiver è in grado di assumere.  Inoltre, una community è a disposizione dei caregiver per chi ha bisogno di aiuto e di supporto psicologico.    Come vedete dalla foto, sprizziamo felicità da tutti i pori!!!

Insieme, abbiamo deciso di creare dei momenti corali in cui i partecipanti al programma delle diverse città potessero incontrarsi, costruendo occasioni divertenti ma anche di scambio e di sfida in cui portare alla luce nuove idee per la risoluzione di alcuni dei temi più caldi della contemporaneità.    In quanto partecipanti attivi della nostra società e futuri lavoratori, gli studenti saranno chiamati a ragionare su che cos’è lo sviluppo resiliente, su come migliorare i trasporti e l’accessibilità tramite le tecnologie, su come creare comunità urbane smart, su come favorire la transizione ecologica e su come tutelare il territorio e il suo patrimonio storico-artistico.    Durante le 6 giornate, 60 team di ragazzi provenienti da 60 scuole a livello nazionale, per un totale di 600 ragazzi, si riuniranno in una delle 6 scuole polo per sfidarsi a colpi di idee, per testare le competenze STEAM acquisite nei percorsi svolti lo scorso anno scolastico, convincere una giuria scelta ad incoronarli come migliori HubSteamers e vincere l'invito all'Hackathon nazionale del 15 dicembre a Lucca.

"Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.    Greetings connections!  I'm extremely delighted to share that our team - SwasthyaVardhak won the in the grand finale held at for working on the Problem Statement given by which aims to digitize doctors' handwriting for easy access to everyone.    We created a mobile application which has a scanner that captures the image of a prescription and converts it into readable format using an ML model in the back-end.    Our team's journey was quite a rollercoaster ride with us being waitlisted in the despite all the hardwork, and loosing hope to be a part of the Finale, then overjoyed when got selected for nationals, working during the pre and the end semester examinations, hunting datasets and coming up with an approach that ditched us in the end, even after that we worked harder and implemented a solution that was up for evaluation, then came the most tragic thing- crashed during the demonstration in the final evaluation. Working hard for sleepless 36+ hours, we did it and the long haul made us win the battle.    Sharing my heartfelt gratitude to my team, winning would have been impossible without all six of us, I couldn't imagine a better team working this hard for SIH.    you were always the overall workforce whether it be the selection of team members, brainstorming over ideas for the problem statements, app designing, and working as well as integrating the model solution.    the most cheerful member, but the most calm and composed person while working, and implementing every possible feature in the application on one single thought is something we couldn't have won without.    working hard and valuing every single work we did, always boosting our morale and making us not loose hope, specially in my case, you were the one who believed our hardwork will surely make us emerge with flying colours.    the epic team player, the true example of working hard in silence and let our success be the noise!, the ""sankat mochan"" of our team as Manish calls you.    here we go, the zero minute inactive member of our team, the caffeine and hardwork addict who worked on every theoretical aspect to be well implemented in our solution.      I'd like to extend a special thanks to our evaluators and mentors , and for the suggestions in our solution. We were overwhelmed by your aura and the knowledge you provided us, most importantly, confiding us that we'll come up with a solution in near future with our continuous efforts.  I'd also like to thank our team mentor Dr. Pratima Singh ma'am and sir for the constant guidance, support and helping us throughout the process.

"START-UP ITALIANE TRA INCAPACI E FUFFAROLI  Il jet set delle #startup italiane lo puoi trovare dietro nomenclature inglesi quali #accelerator, #incubator, #hackathon, summit, competition o #ventures.    Se nella testa hai l'idea di fare lo startupper, l'imprenditore virtuoso che vuole portare una sul mercato e costruire magari anche una nuova categoria di business... beh, devi leggere il post che ti linko nel primo commento.     Perchè per chi fa startup c'è un mondo di spazzatura dal quale stare lontani. False , mercati del pesce, .  Lo descrive molto bene che ci è passato e che non criminalizza tutto il sistema, ci mancherebbe, ma gran parte di questo.     Occhio che nessuno regala mai niente.    Occhio soprattutto a non perdere il tuo TEMPO.    Ed è proprio sul valore del tempo, sul suo significato, che sono rimasto colpito dalle parole di Lorenzo:     -- I soldi comprano l’unica risorsa davvero limitata: il tempo. Tempo di produrre un bene, tempo di erogare un servizio, tempo di raccogliere informazioni, tempo di fare una proposta, tempo di negoziarla. Tempo perso se non chiudi il deal. La differenza fondamentale tra il consumatore e l’imprenditore è che per il consumatore il tempo è una commodity: c’è e va consumato; per l’imprenditore il tempo è un asset: non c’è e deve moltiplicarsi. Visto il grado di analfabetizzazione imprenditoriale italiana, di cui sono primo positivo sintomatico, l’unico bisogno che il circuito startappe dovrebbe indurre è il capire il prima possibile la legge universale che determinerà la tua impresa, cioè il rapporto micidiale tra soldi e tempo: quando finiscono i soldi, hai finito il tempo. --    Link nel primo commento.

"27 settembre 2012: TechCrunch Italy al Globe Theatre di Roma    10 anni fa ho avuto la fortuna di lavorare all'organizzazione e comunicazione del primo evento di TechCrunch in Italia, coorganizzato con Populis.    All'epoca non era mai stato fatto nulla del genere: top speaker e VC internazionali, il meglio delle startup italiane (molte avrebbero fatto exit da lì a pochi anni, altre sono ancora il meglio dell'ecosistema di oggi), l'allora ministro Passera alla vigilia della legge sulle startup, un hackathon, decine di giornalisti e oltre 1000 partecipanti.    Non sarà stato tutto perfetto, ma si respirava un'atmosfera incredibile.    Per me è stato l'inizio di un bellissimo percorso dedicato a far conoscere l'innovazione italiana, attraverso le storie di tante aziende. Oggi il contesto è totalmente cambiato (è pure crollato il Globe qualche giorno fa 😅), così come l'entusiasmo verso questi temi - ma non il mio!    Oggi celebro questo ""anniversario"" speciale, ripensando a chi ha condiviso con me quell'esperienza e gli anni successivi, ma soprattutto a chi mi ha dato allora quella bellissima opportunità!",Tech PR Advisor

"🏫Il mondo della #scuola è sempre in evoluzione. Con l’avvento della tecnologia si stanno diffondendo sempre di più gli #Hackathon.    ❓Ma cosa sono?  Iniziamo subito dal termine. La parola Hackathon nasce dall’unione di “hack” (violare, attaccare) e “marathon” (maratona).    Usato per la prima volta nel 1999, il termine hackathon rappresenta eventi no stop con diverse durate (un giorno, una settimana, un weekend…). In queste ore i partecipanti hanno l’opportunità di confrontarsi con esperti di diversi settori: dall’informatica alla didattica, dall’ambiente al sociale.    L’obiettivo di queste “sfide” è centrare in pieno il vero significato della parola competizione che deriva dal latino cum+petere = domandare insieme.  Durante gli hackathon ci si domanda infatti cosa non va attorno a noi e, con , e lungimiranza, si pensa a possibili da applicare per migliorare questi problemi.  Da problema a soluzione quindi. Il tutto viene fatto sviluppando nei partecipanti un’ottica di consapevolezza, responsabilità, lavoro di squadra e innovazione.    🆕Oltre agli hackathon sono sempre più frequenti in Italia progetti innovativi che si basano su una didattica sensoriale e comunicativa. Tra questi c’è il nato ispirandosi alla metodologia Challenge Based Learning (CBL).    Si tratta di un laboratorio didattico-innovativo di mappatura collettiva e partecipata di un luogo. I partecipanti vengono portati in un luogo e immersi tra le bellezze naturali e artificiali dell’uomo devono mettere in connessione i cinque sensi integrando così i dati percettivi con le conoscenze culturali e geografiche di un territorio.    🎯L’obiettivo è trovare soluzioni a problematiche del luogo che generano nei partecipanti delle sensazioni negative o di fastidio. L’obiettivo è stimolare nelle nuove generazioni la capacità di vedere con occhi diversi il territorio e nutrire l’interesse culturale rispetto al valore estetico del posto.",264 followers

"🌟 Ringrazio Carloalberto Sartor che, quando abbiamo trattato il tema delle donne che hanno fatto la storia, ha suggerito il grande personaggio di #AdaLovelace. Ada è stata anche la figura di riferimento per l’#AdaHack sull'intelligenza artificiale, uno splendido hackathon in cui ho fatto da mentor per i ragazzi di , nella meravigliosa sede di con , e .    👩 Chi fu Ada? Sicuramente una grande matematica britannica. Nata nel 1815, crebbe senza il padre che lasciò la famiglia quando lei aveva ancora pochi mesi di vita. Fin da giovane si appassionò alle scienze matematiche e durante l’adolescenza fu addirittura considerata da tutti, insegnanti compresi, un piccolo genio. I suoi studi riguardavano in particolar modo la matematica, l’algebra e la tecnologia. Appena diciassettenne incontrò il padre dell’informatica Charles Babbage, con il quale iniziò una bellissima e stretta collaborazione.    👩 Babbage chiese ad Ada di tradurre in inglese i lavori del matematico italiano Luigi Menabrea proprio sulla macchina di Babbage, ma lei oltre alla traduzione aggiunse vari appunti incluso un algoritmo per il calcolo dei numeri di Bernoulli. A partire da questo algoritmo, Ada sviluppò un programma per un calcolatore: questo fu il primo esempio di software della storia, nonché la scoperta più innovativa della scienziata, che gettò le basi della moderna informatica.    👩 Ada morì a soli 36 anni per un tumore ed è considerata anche oggi un simbolo per tutte le donne che dedicano la loro vita alla scienza e alla ricerca, nonostante per lungo tempo il suo contributo venne spesso ignorato e sottovalutato in quanto, all’epoca, gli studi scientifici venivano erroneamente associati solo agli uomini. Nel 1979 però, il Ministero della Difesa statunitense onorò la sua memoria e il suo lavoro chiamando “Ada” un linguaggio di programmazione.    👉 Ci sono altre figure che conosci a cui sei particolarmente affezionato?

Even if I don't win, what matters is the experience!    Although were unable to achieve what we have envisioned, I can say that I am very proud of our team's accomplishment considering this is our first time joining such a technical-inclined hackathon. We managed to satisfy most of the requirements and made placeholders on the actual website in less than 24 hours, not bad for a team of second years.    Thank you team,   , for the commitment and support. Special shout out to our fantastic mentor  for his guidance throughout the hackathon.    Finally, a big thank you to  for the internship opportunity. Excited to join one of the big names in the industry!

"😁    Je suis très fier de ma femme Zeineb GHRIB et je pense qu'elle est un modèle pour la femme tunisienne et française; Je vais vous expliquer pourquoi:    👉 Elle et son équipe ont terminé à la première place du prestigieux hackathon ""Women in Data Science"" organisé par l'Université de Stanford. Ce hackathon a accueilli plus de 800 équipes réparties dans 90 pays.    👉 Elle est la seule femme finaliste qui a représenté la France 🇫🇷 (équipe majoritairement française) et la Tunisie 🇹🇳 (elle est de nationalité Tunisienne). Toutes les autres gagnantes sont américaines.    👉 En plus de son excellent niveau technique, elle est une personne très humble, toujours en train d'apprendre, de découvrir, de discuter d'histoire, de philosophie, de musique et évidemment de mangas.     👉 Elle a gagné de l'argent lors de ce hackathon mais elle l'a entièrement fait don à un hôpital pour enfants atteints de cancer. Bien qu'elle me détestera pour avoir partagé cette information, cela montre à quel point elle est généreuse et responsable.      👉 Elle a toujours eu un excellent niveau, elle a obtenu presque 19/20 au BAC et a terminé dans le top 100 au concours prépa Tunisien.    👉 C'est une guerrière, elle a traversé de nombreuses épreuves pendant ses études d'ingénieur, notamment une dépression et une désorientation, mais elle a réussi à se lever, elle a obtenu d'excellents résultats pendant son master Data Science @ et elle est devenue l'une des meilleures dans son domaine.

"Oggi abbiamo avuto il piacere di ospitare, nella nostra sede di Napoli, la 🌿 Green Hackathon Day Challange 🌿 una sfida sulla sostenibilità d'impresa nella cornice del nostro corso in partenza ""Green Idea Campania"" per la realizzazione di idee imprenditoriali sostenibili. Dopo Una breve presentazione del progetto, i ragazzi, divisi in squadre, hanno lavorato insieme per trovare soluzione ad una challange sostenibile di gestione delle risorse d'impresa.  Hanno sviluppato tre idee davvero creative, ma il gruppo vincitore è stato il gruppo uno, che ha presentato una creativa idea per combattere lo spreco di plastica in azienda tramite l'impiego di bottiglie di allumnio riciclabili sul lungo termine, personalizzate per ogni impiegato, e l'installazione di un impianto di depurazione interno. Non vediamo l'ora di cominciare il corso per poter dare loro le risorse per rendere realizzabili tutte queste idee! 💪    -----    Today, we had the pleasure of hosting the 🌿 Green Hackathon Day Challange 🌿 a challenge on business sustainability in the framework of our start-up course ""Green Idea Campania"" for the realisation of sustainable business ideas. After a short presentation of the project, the students, divided into teams, worked together to find solutions to a sustainable enterprise resource management challange.  They developed three really creative ideas, but the winning team was group one, which presented a creative idea to combat plastic waste in the company through the use of long-term recyclable aluminium bottles, customised for each employee, and the installation of an in-house purification plant. We can't wait for the course to start so that we can give them the resources to make all these ideas achievable! 💪","1,327 followers"

"Oggi, venerdì 27 maggio 2022, ho partecipato e avuto la fortuna di essere scelta e premiata al primo DA Hackathon organizzato dal DIETI, in collaborazione con il Project Management Institute e Agile Campania Agile Campania, nonchè l'immenso onore di poter incontrare veri professionisti che lavorano nel campo dell'Agile da quasi 20 anni.    Attraverso il PMI Disciplined Agile Business Game di oggi, abbiamo potuto mettere in pratica chiavi fondamentali per conoscere ed utilizzare l'Agile: definire e incrementare la WoW, utilizzare il tool raDAr, costruire dei veri Disciplined Agile Process Goal Diagrams per costruire una Company New Business Strategy, facilitando i processi di leading and decision marking, focalizzandosi sulla formazione e benessere psicologico del team.  La metodologia Agile traduce a pieno il mio mindset e come interpreto i miei obiettivi ogni giorno ( Adapt, Evolve e Respond): negli ultimi anni, infatti, ho cambiato totalmente ambito, adattandomi al mondo in continua evoluzione, ho stravolto la mia mission per rispondere alle challenge del futuro, abbracciando orgogliosamente nuove discipline STEM.    E' per questa ragione che sono ancora più emozionata di essere stata l'unica donna, tra oltre settanta ingegneri partecipanti oggi, a vincere questo primo Hackathon e aver potuto rappresentare non solo la che mi ha formata e supportata, ma anche tutte le donne appassionate che arricchiscono il mondo delle STEM.    A prescindere dai premi che porterò a casa oggi, ciò che davvero conserverò per sempre è la possibilità di aver incontrato, essere ispirata e ricevuto consigli preziosi da mentori eccezionali come ad esempio , , , , , , e tanti altri.  Un grazie speciale alla prof. , che mi ha dato la possibilità di partecipare a questo importante evento e che ha realizzato una collaborazione di successo tra il Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell'Informazione (DIETI), il Project Management Institute (PMI), associazione internazionale leader nel campo del Project Management, e Xebir, società che si occupa di trasformazione Agile, dando la possibilità di ricevere un riconoscimento ufficiale delle competenze acquisite nell'ambito delle metodologie Agili e Lean con certificazione di DAMS.",Agile PM at NetcomGroup | Product Owner for Stellantis | former PMO at Deloitte Consulting | Digita Academy: Digital Transformation and Technological Innovation: Industry 4.0
"Ultimamente estive sumido, mas foi por uma razão muito especial: Estava finalizando a construção do meu novo #setup !  E quero contar um pouco dessa #conquista (e passar umas dicas para os novatos).    Na 1@ imagem, está a máquina onde comecei minha jornada: o DELLzinho (4GB de RAM, HD de 480GB, Processador Core i5 descontinuado, sem placa de vídeo) - foi com isso, onde comecei a em 2019. Ah, e naquela epoca eu tinha pouco !    Na 2@ imagem, está o setup atual: Monitor DELL P2227H, Lenovo IdeaPad S145 (com uma boa configuração), Teclado T-Dagger Bora, Mouse T-Dagger, HeadSet Fortrek G, Caixa JBL GO 3 (e o celular que uso é um Xiaomi Redmi Note 8). Só que, cada item que listei, nesse parágrafo, foi pago com o meu próprio dinheiro (e sim, hoje em dia eu tenho dinheiro! 🙏).    Só que, nesse intervalo de 3 anos, aconteceram muitas coisas que eu não esperava que me levariam até aqui, e aqui vai algumas:    1 - Minha equipe ficou em 2° lugar em um (o que me gerou um bom dinheiro de inicio).  2 - Sai da Eng. Elétrica na UEA para me dedicar integralmente a (e essa decisão, deve ter sido a mais importante, pois desisti da minha 1@ graduação com 18 anos).  3 - O IFAM abriu um PSS a parte (aceitando notas de ENEMs anteriores). E foi com isso que retornei a vida acadêmica.  4 - O me deu um espaço para ser (foram 6 meses acumulando bolsas para fazer esse setup) - e tive que fazer meu melhor para passar em alguns cursos (os 2 cursos de ! 😂🤣)    Beleza Carlitos, tu conquistou isso tudo, mas, e aí?! Quais os conselhos que tu podes me passar? Aqui vão alguns:    1. Vai ter momentos onde, você terá que fazer escolhas indesejáveis.  2. Vai ter momentos, que se a sorte sorrir pra você, a sua história pode mudar completamente (comigo foi o HackaThon e a aprovação no IFAM), então, esteja preparado para as oportunidades!  3. Estude, e estude muito!! Graças aos 2 anos de estudo prévio, minha vida no IFAM foi um pouco tranquila.  4. (Vai dar desânimo? Claro!); (Vai dar vontade de Desistir? Sim, e muito!!); (Vai ter moleza? Nenhum pouco!); Mas ... vale a pena o esforço e a dedicação? Sim, com toda a certeza!! ✌️    Dicas:    1. Quer se encontrar no universo da Programação? Pesquise qualquer área no Google, e pegue quanta informação quiser! Meta a cara! Participe de eventos, palestras, maratonas, cursos on-line; se exponha basicamente!  2. O Guanabara é um heroi para os iniciantes! Procure por ""Curso em Vídeo"" no YT.  3. Aprenda o quanto antes! Por 2 razões bem simples: (1)facilitará em muito seus ; (2)cedo ou tarde, você pode para uma gringa (e eu já recebi uma proposta dessas, mas não tinha como eu concorrer).    Acho que é isso!

Aligned with this vision, Dubai developed a technological infrastructure that rivals the best in the world and built strong partnerships with companies at the forefront of innovation in the sector to catalyse development.”    “The largest-ever GITEX GLOBAL signifies Dubai’s position at the forefront of ushering in a new wave of innovation and value creation in the sector. This year’s edition features a vast diversity of expertise, which represents not only the global industry’s current dynamism but also its future potential. The strong response the event has drawn from the international technology community also points to Dubai’s emergence as a city that is vital to shaping the future of the industry,” His Highness added.    GITEX GLOBAL will explore every facet of the digital through seven experience ecosystems — North Star Dubai - bringing together a record 1,000 start-ups with 600 investors - Fintech Surge, Ai Everything, Future Blockchain Summit, Marketing Mania and two new event platforms, Global DevSlam and X-VERSE.

"""Hey Kesavan, is there by any chance that I can join the upcoming Hack2Hire as mentor?""    Barely only 3 weeks into the job, I made the bold move to volunteer as mentor for the latest iteration of ' Virtual Hack2Hire event.    If you ask me why, it's because I got to where I am now literally because of this platform. The least I could do is go back and essentially give back to the community by using my experience to help others achieve the same dream as I did a year ago.    By pure chance, I got assigned to roughly the same mentees that I mentored during UMHackathon 2021, for the team Logos. Unlike that competition however, I can certainly say that mentors in Hack2Hire play an arguably even bigger role; not just in giving technical advices but also to motivate them to endure the pressure along the way.    The latter especially couldn't be more true and prominent for me. Not only that I convinced my assigned team to keep their chin up and restrategise despite being unable to develop a fully-functional MVP, but I even went out of my way to call and persuade my dear friend and his teammate to not call it quits due to unforeseen circumstances, and stepped in to accompany them for their presentation rehearsal despite not being their mentor.    I realised that since I was once in their shoes, that experience allows me to relate and empathise with them more.    While the past 2 days had been exhausting for me, seeing the faces of many especially my mentees and friends lit up when the results are announced made it all worthwhile.    Not only all of my Logos team members , , and managed to get the internship offers, but 's team Bit Legion was also among the special mentioned teams, to my delight.    Many congratulations as well to my FCSIT UM peers-turned-future-colleagues , , , and for getting the coveted permanent job offers!
